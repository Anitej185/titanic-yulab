# titanic-yulab

A few years ago, the machine learning community had a challenge task, to use the Titanic shipwreck record for basic machine learning work.

There are multiple websites and posted machine learning Python codes to train and test on the Titanic data. I have included two csv file from the Titanic record: a training dataset, and a testing dataset. I used my adapted Python code to train and test on the attached datasets (Training.csv, Testing.csv) .
